# SOLID Workshop

### Purpose

The purpose of the SOLID workshop is to introduce teams to the S.O.L.I.D. principles of Object Oriented programming.  In this document you will find some basic recommendations for facilitating this workshop and resources for familiarizing yourself and teams to SOLID

## Workshop Structure

### Introduction

Explain what is SOLID at a high level without diving into each letter of the acronym, attempt to answer the following questions:
  *Why is practicing SOLID important?

### Principle Research

Ask participants to individually, as pairs, or small groups break into 5 groups each one seeking out resources and gaining an understanding of one Principle.  Give the groups about 20 minutes to quickly research and prepare to discuss their principle with the other groups.  Groups should share the following about their principle:

* What is the principle?
* Example of before an after code (Code that breaks the principle, and code that enforces the principle)
* Why do the participants feel this principle is important?

### Principle Review

Walk through each Principle asking the teams to present their quick and dirty understanding of the principle.  The facilitator should add color to the conversation and help the participants gain an understanding of each Principle, What it means, Why it is important, and some ideas for how to apply the Principle when leaving the workshop.

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

### Debrief

In the debrief it is important to highlight that this is only the start of the conversation
